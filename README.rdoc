Hello there! Today I present a complete and proper dump of the Bytecode from Toontown Online sv1.0.6.9, along with some extra files. Enjoy! BTW, the old Panda 3D is there so you can view the models. I've provided instructions on how to view them properly. Decompile of bytecode was done using Uncompyle6. Thanks to toonjoey for doing thatm and sending the resulting files.
